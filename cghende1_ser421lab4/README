I tried to make a fuzzy scoring engine for Eliza which KINDA works. You can
say things like "fugly" and still get the "ugly" responses. However, once
it gets more complicated I don't really understand the behavior and it can
get bizarre.

So...if more complicated sentences don't make sense....yeah. Oh well.
