Anytime there's a news report or research study that says one specific vitamin, nutrient, or food X reduces the risk for disease or health outcome Y, my first reaction is to always question the validity and practical application of this information. In our food culture, there is a tendency to focus on individual components in our diet and to try to determine whether these components offer health benefits. This is why I think supplements are so popular. I think what matters more for health is the big picture of all the the foods we eat as a collective whole, not individual components of our diet.
